# FBSMSLib

A Python library for Fritz!Box authentication and SMS management. This library allows you to send and receive SMS messages through your Fritz!Box router programmatically.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Send SMS messages with configurable rate limiting
- ‚úÖ Send SMS to multiple recipients
- ‚úÖ Retrieve incoming SMS messages
- ‚úÖ Two-factor authentication (TOTP) support
- ‚úÖ Automatic session management
- ‚úÖ Integrated rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Fritz!Box with firmware version 8.03 or later (PBKDF2 support required)
- SMS functionality enabled on your Fritz!Box
- Valid Fritz!Box user credentials + activated TOTP with SMS permissions

## Quick Start

```python
from fbsmslib import FBSMSLib

# Initialize the library
fbsms = FBSMSLib(
    url="http://192.168.178.1",  # Your Fritz!Box IP
    username="your_username",
    password="your_password",
    totpsecret="YOUR_TOTP_SECRET"
)

# Send a single SMS
fbsms.send_sms("+4915228895456", "Hello from Fritz!Box!")

# Get incoming SMS messages
incoming_messages = fbsms.get_sms_incoming()
for msg in incoming_messages:
    print(f"From: {msg['sender']}")
    print(f"Message: {msg['text']}")
    print(f"Date: {msg['date']}")
    print("-" * 40)
```

The TOTP secret is required since sending SMS requires two-factor authentication to be enabled on the Fritz!Box user.

NOTE: The library is blocking and synchronous right now. The fritzbox web interface is not designed for high-frequency access. Use with caution in multi-threaded or asynchronous environments!

## Configuration

### Fritz!Box Setup

1. Enable SMS functionality in your Fritz!Box settings
2. Create a user account with SMS permissions
3. Go to Fritz!Box settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Fritz!Box Users
4. Edit your user and enable "Authentication app"
5. Scan the QR code and note the secret key

## API Reference

### FBSMSLib Class

#### Constructor

```python
FBSMSLib(url: str, username: str, password: str, totpsecret: str, rate: Rate = None)
```

- `url`: Fritz!Box web interface URL (e.g., "http://192.168.178.1")
- `username`: Fritz!Box username
- `password`: Fritz!Box password
- `totpsecret`: TOTP secret for 2FA (if enabled)
- `rate`: Optional `Rate` object from `pyrate_limiter` to customize rate limiting (default is 10 SMS/hour)

#### Methods

##### send_sms(receiver: str, message: str)

Send an SMS message to a single recipient.

```python
fbsms.send_sms("+4915228895456", "Your message here")
```

##### send_sms_multiple(receiver: list[str], message: str)

Send an SMS message to multiple recipients with automatic delay between sends.

```python
recipients = ["+4915228895456", "+491729925904"]
fbsms.send_sms_multiple(recipients, "Broadcast message")
```

##### get_sms() -> list

Get all SMS messages (sent and received).

```python
all_messages = fbsms.get_sms()
```

##### get_sms_incoming() -> list

Get only incoming SMS messages.

```python
incoming = fbsms.get_sms_incoming()
```

## Examples

### Basic SMS Sending

```python
from fbsmslib import FBSMSLib

fbsms = FBSMSLib(
    url="http://192.168.178.1",
    username="admin",
    password="your_password",
    totpsecret="ABCD1234EFGH5678"
)

# Send a simple message
fbsms.send_sms("+491729925904", "Hello World!")
```

### Monitoring Incoming Messages

```python
import time
from fbsmslib import FBSMSLib

fbsms = FBSMSLib(
    url="http://192.168.178.1",
    username="admin",
    password="your_password",
    totpsecret="ABCD1234EFGH5678"
)

# Check for new messages every 30 seconds
while True:
    incoming = fbsms.get_sms_incoming()
    
    for msg in incoming:
        print(f"üì± New SMS from {msg['sender']}")
        print(f"üí¨ {msg['text']}")
        print(f"üïê {msg['date']}")
        print("-" * 40)
    
    time.sleep(30)
```

### Bulk SMS Sending

```python
from fbsmslib import FBSMSLib

fbsms = FBSMSLib(
    url="http://192.168.178.1",
    username="admin",
    password="your_password",
    totpsecret="ABCD1234EFGH5678"
)

# Send to multiple recipients
contacts = [
    "+4915228895456",
    "+491729968532",
    "+491749464308"
]

message = "Important announcement: Server maintenance tonight at 2 AM"
fbsms.send_sms_multiple(contacts, message)
```

### Advanced: Custom Rate Limiting

The library includes built-in rate limiting (10 SMS per hour) on a leaky bucket algorithm. The rate limit is enforced automatically, but may be customized by providing a `Rate` object from the `pyrate_limiter` library.

```python
from fbsmslib import FBSMSLib
from pyrate_limiter import Rate, Duration

fbsms = FBSMSLib(
    url="http://192.168.178.1",
    username="admin",
    password="your_password",
    totpsecret="ABCD1234EFGH5678",
    rate=Rate(2, Duration.MINUTE)  # Custom rate limit: 2 SMS per minute
)

# The library will automatically enforce these rate limits
try:
    for i in range(3):  # Try to send 15 messages
        fbsms.send_sms("+491749464308", f"Message {i}")
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Rate limit hit: {e}")
```

## Error Handling

Common exceptions you might encounter:

- `RuntimeError`: Rate limit exceeded or network issues
- `Exception`: Authentication failures or Fritz!Box communication errors
- `NotImplementedError`: Unsupported 2FA methods

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"FRITZ!Box does not support PBKDF2"**
   - Update your Fritz!Box firmware to version 7.24 or later

2. **"wrong username or password"**
   - Verify your credentials
   - Ensure the user has SMS permissions

3. **Rate limit exceeded**
   - Wait for the rate limit window to reset
   - Consider batching messages with delays

4. **Connection errors**
   - Verify Fritz!Box IP address and network connectivity
   - Check if Fritz!Box web interface is accessible
